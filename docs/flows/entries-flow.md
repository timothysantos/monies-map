# Entries Flow

This doc describes the Entries page flow in three parts:

- route flow
- state flow
- data flow

## Route Flow

Route entry:

- `/entries`

The route state carries the active view, month, and entry filters. The browser
location is the source of truth for the current filter contract.

## State Flow

Entries state is split between:

- route state for view, month, and filters
- server state for the entries page DTO
- workflow state for quick-entry, inline editing, add-to-splits, and delete
- transient UI state for mobile sheets and dialogs

The page should keep rows visible while draft edits are in progress and only
apply the final contract on save.

## Data Flow

Entries data comes from:

- `GET /api/entries-page`

Entries mutations may also refresh:

- `month`
- `summary`
- `splits`

depending on the kind of change and whether the row change affects ledger
evidence.

## Ownership Notes

Entries owns:

- route filter parsing
- row editing
- quick-entry persistence
- add-to-splits behavior
- delete behavior

## Audit Status

Current status: aligned with tests and runtime behavior.

Watch area:

- keep filtered rows visible while edits are still draft-only

## Known Exceptions / Watch Areas

- draft-only row edits should remain visible until the user saves
- add-to-splits and transfer-link behavior may fan out to month and summary
  refreshes when ledger evidence changes
